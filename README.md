First, I was tasked to create **NPCs** with unique characteristics, and I had to make **10** of them. For each NPC, I needed at least 1 prompt for user input, and I used the input for giving the name, and the low/high range of their **age**. Each NPC needed at least 3 attributes, not including the needed **Name** and **age**. 
I also needed certain programming constructions, including comments that briefly  explained the purpose of each **major** section of my code, I needed to include at least one of each data type, which were **integers, strings, floats, and booleans.**
I needed to use built-in functions, like **print**, **if and else statements**, etc. 
I needed to **import** and use a **library**, so I decided to use the **random** library, so I could get random characteristics for my code, and I did this for the height, age, their favorite integer number, and their favorite float number. 
I needed to use a **for** and **while** loop, which I did not end up using, because I forgot that I needed to do it, and I didn't want to restart my code. 
I finally needed to use a list to store all of my character's characteristics, and I did this at the end of my code. My final output re
