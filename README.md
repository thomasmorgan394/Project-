## Explanation of my code. 
First, I was tasked to create **NPCs** that had unique characteristics, and I had to make **10** of them. For each NPC, I needed at least 1 prompt for user input, and I used the input for giving the name, and the low/high range of their **age**. Each NPC needed at least 3 attributes, not including the needed **Name** and **age**. 
I also needed certain programming constructions, including comments that briefly  explained the purpose of each **major** section of my code, I needed to include at least one of each data type, which were **integers, strings, floats, and booleans.**
I needed to use built in functions, like **print**, **if and else statements**, etc.
