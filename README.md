## Explanation of my code. 
First, I was tasked to create **NPCs** that had unique characteristics, and I had to make **10** of them. For each NPC, I needed at least 1 prompt for user input, and I used the input for giving the name, and the low/high range of their **age**. Each NPC needed at least 3 attributes, including the needed **Name** and **age**.
